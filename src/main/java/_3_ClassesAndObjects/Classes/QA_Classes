Questions and Exercises: Classes
Questions
Consider the following class:

public class IdentifyMyParts {
    public static int x = 7;
    public int y = 3;
}
What are the class variables?

What are the instance variables?

What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y);
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y);
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x);
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x);
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);

Exercises
1. Write a class whose instances represent a single playing card
   from a deck of cards. Playing cards have two distinguishing
   properties: rank and suit. Be sure to keep your solution as
   you will be asked to rewrite it in Enum Types.

Hint:
You can use the assert statement to check your assignments. You write:

assert (boolean expression to test);
If the boolean expression is false, you will get an error
message. For example,

assert toString(ACE) == "Ace";
should return true, so there will be no error message.

If you use the assert statement, you must run your program with
the ea flag:

java -ea YourProgram.class

2. Write a class whose instances represent a full deck of cards.
   You should also keep this solution.

3. Write a small program to test your deck and card classes.
   The program can be as simple as creating a deck of cards
   and displaying its cards.

Answers to Questions and Exercises: Classes

Questions

1. Consider the following class:

public class IdentifyMyParts {
    public static int x = 7;
    public int y = 3;
}
Question: What are the class variables?

Answer: x

Question: What are the instance variables?

Answer: y

Question: What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y);
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y);
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x);
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x);
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);
Answer: Here is the output:

 a.y = 5
 b.y = 6
 a.x = 2
 b.x = 2
 IdentifyMyParts.x = 2
Because x is defined as a public static int in the class IdentifyMyParts, every reference to x will have the value that was last assigned because x is a static variable (and therefore a class variable) shared across all instances of the class. That is, there is only one x: when the value of x changes in any instance it affects the value of x for all instances of IdentifyMyParts.

This is covered in the Class Variables section of Understanding Instance and Class Members.
